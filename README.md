# ready2order Task Boilerplate

This repository contains the TypeScript boilerplate for our task and its webpack setup.

The project is written in Typescript and SASS, based on React and Redux and uses
webpack as a packager.

The preferred package manager is yarn, but npm also works fine.

## Quickstart

Clone the repo, cd into it and run these commands to get a running development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Commands

These are the most important commands that you can run:

* `yarn` - Install all dependencies into node_modules
* `yarn start` - Start the webpack dev server with file system watcher / reloading
* `yarn lint` - Run the tslint linter
* `yarn lint-fix` - Auto-fix fixable linter errors
* `yarn test` - Run all tests
* `yarn test-coverage` - Run all tests and produce a code coverage report
* `yarn build` - Build the whole application bundle
